# AI Ops Assistant

AI Ops Assistant is a backend system designed to simulate intelligent operations (ITOps) workflows like log summarization, ticket triage, and changelog generation. It provides a GraphQL API for internal dashboards and automation tools, and supports background processing via worker services.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (1.21)
- **API Layer:** [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via GORM)

## âœ… MVP Overview

The MVP includes four core features:

1. **Log Summarization**
   - Accept raw log data
   - Generate a summary (mocked NLP)
   - Store and retrieve via GraphQL
   - Async summarizer worker included

2. **Ticket Triage**
   - Accept and classify tickets
   - Store in DB
   - Async triage worker included
   - Filter by status

3. **Changelog Generation**
   - Accept commit-like entries
   - Generate structured changelogs
   - Store grouped output as JSON
   - Query by ID or list

4. **Secure Admin API**
   - JWT login and signup
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt
   - Protected queries and mutations
   - `me` query returns user info
