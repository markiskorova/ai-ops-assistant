# AI Ops Assistant

AI Ops Assistant is a backend system designed to simulate intelligent operations (ITOps) workflows like log summarization, ticket triage, and changelog generation. It provides a GraphQL API for internal dashboards and automation tools, and supports background processing via worker services.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go (1.21)
- **API Layer:** [graphql-go](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via GORM)
- **Auth:** JWT (planned)
- **Async Processing:** Background worker service (Go)
- **Containerization:** Docker + Docker Compose
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform (planned)
- **Frontend (planned):** React

## âœ… MVP Overview

The MVP includes four core features:

1. **Log Summarization**
   - Accept raw log data
   - Generate a summary (currently mocked)
   - Store and retrieve via GraphQL

2. **Ticket Triage**
   - Accept tickets with status and message
   - Classify/store in DB
   - Triage logic (worker-based) is planned

3. **Changelog Generation**
   - Accept commit-like entries
   - Generate release changelogs
   - Placeholder for future implementation

4. **Secure Admin API**
   - JWT-protected access (planned)
   - User login and role-based access control
