# AI Ops Assistant â€“ MVP Roadmap & Status (Updated June 2025)

## ðŸ“Œ MVP Overview
The MVP focuses on 4 core functionalities:
1. **Log Summarization** â€“ Generate concise summaries of raw logs.
2. **Ticket Triage** â€“ Classify/prioritize tickets based on severity/category.
3. **Changelog Generation** â€“ Generate structured release changelogs.
4. **Secure Admin API** â€“ Provide JWT-authenticated access to all data.

## âœ… Phase 1 â€“ Planning & Setup (Complete)
- [x] Define MVP functionality
- [x] Select tech stack (Go, GraphQL-go, PostgreSQL, JWT, Docker, Terraform, React)
- [x] Create project structure (API, worker, internal packages)
- [x] Setup GitHub repository
- [x] Initialize Docker Compose with PostgreSQL
- [x] Setup graphql-go with modular schema layout
- [x] Initialize Terraform configuration

## âœ… Phase 2 â€“ MVP Backend Implementation

### âœ… Step 5: Log Summarization
- [x] Create `LogEntry` PostgreSQL model
- [x] Add `summarizeLog` mutation to GraphQL schema
- [x] Store logs and mock summaries in DB
- [x] Add `logEntry(id)` and `logEntries(limit)` queries
- [x] Add `created_at` timestamp to model
- [x] Create standalone summarization worker
- [x] Run worker in Docker using shared .env
- [x] Confirm background summarization loop works

### âœ… Step 6: Ticket Triage
- [x] Add `TriageTicket` mutation in graphql-go
- [x] Connect mutation to PostgreSQL via GORM
- [x] Add `ticket` query to retrieve by ID
- [x] Implement async worker-based triage
- [x] Add ticket listing or filtered query

### âœ… Step 7: Changelog Generation
- [x] Add `GenerateChangelog` mutation to GraphQL schema
- [x] Define input format and structure (e.g., commit messages or structured entries)
- [x] Process commit-like messages into structured changelogs
- [x] Add database model for changelogs
- [x] Add query for retrieving changelogs

### âœ… Step 8: Secure Admin API & Auth
- [x] Add JWT middleware for GraphQL endpoint
- [x] Create user table and login mutation
- [x] Restrict mutations/queries to authorized users
- [x] Add password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Add `signup` mutation
- [x] Add `me` query

## ðŸ“¦ Planned for Future
- CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions
- Real log/ticket ingestion (S3, webhook, SNS)
- Extended frontend dashboard with metrics/visualizations
- Add observability (tracing/logging)
- Optional: model fine-tuning or plugin NLP enhancements
